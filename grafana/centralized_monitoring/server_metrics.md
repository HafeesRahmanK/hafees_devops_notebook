# Server & Service Monitoring Dashboard Documentation
## 1.Overview
This Grafana dashboard provides real-time monitoring for infrastructure (Linux Servers) and applications (HTTP/TCP Services). It is designed with a **"Management by Exception"** philosophy:
* **Top Row:** High-level status totals (Are we healthy?).
* **Bottom Row:** Exception lists (What specifically is broken?).
* **Middle Rows:** Detailed performance metrics per server.
